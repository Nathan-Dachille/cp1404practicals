# Practical 10 Reflection

## Time Estimates

I have learnt that I am not very good at estimating the length of time that some of the practicals take to complete and 
my accuracy has not really improved much since the start of the practicals.

## Code Reviews

From reviewing other peoples code I have learnt alot about how to notice mistakes or oversights in my own code and how 
best to deliver advice on how other people can fix their own code.

From getting my own code reviewed I have learned that I can often overlook some details in my own code and that I miss 
mistakes more often then I think I do. One example was the advice that I got to condense repetitive code into its own
function.

**Some Example Code Reviews:**

## Practical Tasks

I think the practicals for this subject are great and cover most of the content very well. However, If there was one
thing that could be improved it would be more coverage of some of the specific use cases of Pythons such as processing 
large datasets or even neural network using the likes of Keras/Tensorflow.
